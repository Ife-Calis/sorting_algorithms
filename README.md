## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to `explain to anyone`, __without the help of Google:__

### General
* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm
